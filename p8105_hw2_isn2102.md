### Problem 1: Mr. Trashwheel

**Read in Mr. Trashwheel dataset:**

``` r
trashwheel_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% #this only gets rid of NA values in the dumpster col
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls), 
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls) #can modify the previous variable we just mutated
  )
```

**Read in precipitation data for 2017 and 2018:**

``` r
precip2018_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip2017_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

**Combine two precipitation datasets:**

``` r
month_df <-
  tibble(
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df <-
  bind_rows(precip2017_df, precip2018_df)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

**Extract out variables to use for the paragraph below - total
precipitation and median sports balls in 2017.**

``` r
# Total precipitation
precip_2017 <- sum(pull(filter(precip_df, year == 2017), total))

precip_2018 <- sum(pull(filter(precip_df, year == 2018), total))
  
# Median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017
med_balls <- median(pull(filter(trashwheel_df, year == 2017), sports_balls))
```

This dataset has information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. When trash enters the harbor, the trashwheel
collects it and puts it into a dumpster. The dataset has information on
year, month, and trash collected, including some specific types of
trash. There are a total of 344 rows in the final Mr. Trashwheel
dataset. It includes variables: dumpster, month, year, date,
weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags,
sports\_balls, homes\_powered and has data from 2014 to 2019. The median
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8. Additional data
sheets include month precipitation data. The total precipitation in 2017
was 32.93 inches. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

### Problem 2: NYC transit

**Read in dataset and perform data cleaning steps:**

``` r
subway_df <- read_csv("./Data/NYC_Transit_Subway.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,     route1:route11, entry, entrance_type, vending, ada) %>% 
  {mutate(., entry = (ifelse((pull(., entry) == "YES"), TRUE, FALSE)))}
```

The NYC transit dataset contains information about subway stations in
NYC. Initially the dataset contained variables detailing each entrance
and exit location at every station, along with additional details about
which subway lines serve the station. After cleaning the names and
removing some of the variables, the final dataset contains variables
line, station\_name, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, route1,
route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, entry, entrance\_type, vending, ada. As part of the data
cleaning I changed the entry variable from character to logical, using
mutate and ifelse. After these cleaning steps there are 1868 rows
representing exits/entrances, and 19 columns. These data are not tidy
because the way route is communicated is combining route number and
name.

**Identifying distinct stations, ada complient stations, and proportion
of entrances/exit without vending that allow entry:**

``` r
distinct_stations_df <- distinct(subway_df, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
ada_compliant_num <- nrow(filter(distinct_stations_df, ada == TRUE))
no_vending_df <- subway_df %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") 
prop_entrance = round(nrow(filter(no_vending_df, entry == TRUE)) / nrow(no_vending_df), 3)
```

1.  There are 465 distinct stations.  
2.  84 stations are ADA compliant.
3.  37.7 percent of entrances/exits without vending allow entrance.

**Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.**

``` r
subway_tidy <-
  subway_df %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(route8:route11), as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_num", 
    values_to = "route_name") %>% 
  drop_na(route_name)

A_stations <-
  subway_tidy %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

ADA_A_stations <-
  A_stations %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE)
```

There are 60 unique stations serving the A train. Of those stations, 17
are ADA compliant.

### Problem 3: FiveThirtyEight

**Clean the data in pols-month.csv**  
Separate date variable, make new president variable, remove unnecessary
variables, change month name.

``` r
pols_month_df <- read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)

month_df <-
  tibble(
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

pols_month_df <- left_join(pols_month_df, month_df, by = "month")

pols_month_df <- pols_month_df %>% 
  mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
  select(-month_name)
```

**Clean the data in snp.csv**  
Separate the date variable, remove unnecessary variables, change month
name.

``` r
snp_df <- read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year)

month_df <-
  tibble(
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

snp_df <- left_join(snp_df, month_df, by = "month")

snp_df <- snp_df %>% 
  mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
  select(-month_name)
```

**Clean the data in unemployment.csv**  
Change month name, transpose so month is one variable and unemployment
is one variable.

``` r
unemploy_df <- read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(January = jan, February = feb, March = mar, April = apr, May = may, June = jun, July = jul, August = aug, September = sep, October = oct, November = nov, December = dec) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"),
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemployment")
```

**Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result**

``` r
final_538_df <- 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemploy_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The pols\_month dataset included information on the number of
politicians at different levels that were Republican or Democrat in
different years. The snp dataset included information about the closing
values of the S\&P stock index on the associated date. The unemployment
dataset included information about the percentage of unemployment in a
given month/year. The resulting dataset combined these three and
included 822 observations of 11 variables. Key variables include year,
month, president, close, and unemployment. Information was provided for
years 1947 through 2015.
