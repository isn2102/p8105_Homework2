### Problem 1: Read + clean data

Read in Mr. Trashwheel dataset:

``` r
trashwheel_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% #this only gets rid of NA values in the dumpster col
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls), 
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls) #can modify the previous variable we just mutated
  )
```

Read in precipitation data for 2017 and 2018:

``` r
precip2018_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip2017_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Combine two precipitation datasets:

``` r
month_df <-
  tibble(
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df <-
  bind_rows(precip2017_df, precip2018_df)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

``` r
#Extract out variable for the answers to problem 1 to use in paragraph below. 
```

This dataset has information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. When trash enters the harbor, the trashwheel
collects it and puts it into a dumpster. The dataset has information on
year, month, and trash collected, including some specific types of
trash. There are a total of 344 rows in the final dataset. Additional
data sheets include month precipitation data.
