### Problem 1: Mr. Trashwheel

Read in Mr. Trashwheel dataset:

``` r
trashwheel_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% #this only gets rid of NA values in the dumpster col
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls), 
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls) #can modify the previous variable we just mutated
  )
```

Read in precipitation data for 2017 and 2018:

``` r
precip2018_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip2017_df <- read_xlsx(
  "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
  skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Combine two precipitation datasets:

``` r
month_df <-
  tibble(
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df <-
  bind_rows(precip2017_df, precip2018_df)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

Extract out variables to use for the paragraph below - total
precipitation and median sports balls in 2017.

``` r
# Total precipitation
precip_2017 <- sum(pull(filter(precip_df, year == 2017), total))

precip_2018 <- sum(pull(filter(precip_df, year == 2018), total))
  
# Median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017
med_balls <- median(pull(filter(trashwheel_df, year == 2017), sports_balls))
```

This dataset has information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. When trash enters the harbor, the trashwheel
collects it and puts it into a dumpster. The dataset has information on
year, month, and trash collected, including some specific types of
trash. There are a total of 344 rows in the final Mr. Trashwheel
dataset. It includes variables: dumpster, month, year, date,
weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags,
sports\_balls, homes\_powered and has data from 2014 to 2019. The median
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8. Additional data
sheets include month precipitation data. The total precipitation in 2017
was 32.93 inches. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

### Problem 2: NYC transit

Read in dataset and perform data cleaning steps: clean up names, remove
unneeded columns, change type of entry variable.

``` r
subway_df <- read_csv("./Data/NYC_Transit_Subway.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,     route1:route11, entry, entrance_type, vending, ada) %>% 
  {mutate(., entry = (ifelse((pull(., entry) == "YES"), TRUE, FALSE)))}
```

The NYC transit dataset contains information about subway stations in
NYC. Initially the dataset contained variables detailing each entrance
and exit location at every station, along with additional details about
which subway lines serve the station. After cleaning the names and
removing some of the variables, the final dataset contains variables
line, station\_name, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, route1,
route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, entry, entrance\_type, vending, ada. As part of the data
cleaning I changed the entry variable from character to logical, using
mutate and ifelse. After these cleaning steps there are 1868 rows
representing exits/entrances, and 19 columns. These data are not tidy
because the way route is communicated is combining route number and
name.

Answering questions about the dataset: finding distinct stations by line
and station name, ada complient stations, and proportion of
entrances/exit without vending that allow entry.

``` r
distinct_stations <- distinct(subway_df, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
ada_compliant <- nrow(filter(distinct_stations, ada == TRUE))
vending_df <- subway_df %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") 
prop_entrance = nrow(filter(vending_df, entry == TRUE)) / nrow(vending_df)
```

1.  There are 465 distinct stations.  
2.  84 stations are ADA compliant.
3.  0.3770492 stations without vending allow entrance.

### Problem 3: FiveThirtyEight
